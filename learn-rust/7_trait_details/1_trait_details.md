# Trait Details

## Associated Functions

1. For example, let's implement base functions for simply custom type:

    ```rust 

    struct MyType(i32);

    impl MyType {

        fn new () -> MyType{
            MyType(0)
        }

        fn get(&self) -> i32 {
            self.0
        }

        fn set(&mut self, val : i32) {
            self.0 = val
        }

    }

## Associated Types 

1. Associated Types is a helpful feature of Rust for improving the readability of code.

    ```rust

    struct Index(i32);

    trait Joining {
        // Associated types
        type A;
        type B;
        fn join_to_str(&self, _:&Self::A, _:&Self::B) -> String;
    }

    impl Joining for Index {
        // Define type of associated types
        type A = String; 
        type B = String;

        fn join_to_str(&self, name : &Self::A, last_name : &Self::B) -> String {
            format!("{}. {} {}", self.0, name, last_name)
        }
    }

    fn get_join_str<J: Joining>(joining : &J, name : &J::A, last_name : &J::B) -> String {
        format!("Person: {}", joining.join_to_str(name, last_name))
    }

    fn main() {
        let index = Index(10);

        println!("{}", get_join_str(&index, &"John".to_string(), &"Connor".to_string() ) );
    }

    ```

2. Look at the get_joined_str. It uses an associated type. ‚òùÔ∏è For example, how would it look without an associated type:

    ```rust
    fn get_joined_str<A, B, J:Joining<A, B>>(joining: &J, name: &A,
    last_name: &B) -> String {
        format!("Person: {}", joining.join_to_str(name, last_name))
    }
    ```

3. Associated Constants

    ```rust
    trait ConstantValue {
        const VALUE: i32;
    }
    struct MyStruct;

    impl ConstantValue for MyStruct {
        const VALUE: i32 = 10;
    }
    fn main() {
            println!("{}", MyStruct::VALUE);
    }
    ```

## Generic Parameters

1. A few examples of how to set generic parameters üëâ :

    ```rust 

    fn foo<T>(v: &T) {}

    // it can't store references so we need to use a lifetime annotation.
    struct Example<'a T>{
        value : &'a T,
    }

    // like to previous but the T must to implement the DerivedTrait
    struct Example<'a, T: DerivedTrait> {
    value: &'a T,
    }
    
    // T must to implement the DerivedTrait and the DerivedTrait2
    struct Example<'a, T: DerivedTrait + DerivedTrait2> {
    value: &'a T,
    }

    // T must implement the DerivedTrait and the DerivedTrait2.
    struct Example<'a, T>
    where
        T: DerivedTrait + DerivedTrait2,
    {
    value: &'a T,
    }

## Derive macros 

1. You have this structure and would like to print that:

    ```rust 
    fn main() {
        struct Struct  {
            name: String,
            age:i32,
        }

    let v = Struct {
        name: "John".to_string(),
        age: 20,
    };
    println!("{:?}", v);
    }

    // ‚Äú`Struct` cannot be formatted using `{:?}`‚Äù.

    // Because the default formatter doesn‚Äôt know how to convert this type to string. Of course, you can implement the Debug for the Struct (impl Debug for Struct{}), but Rust has a simple solution for similar cases - derive macros.

    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Struct  {
        name: String,
        age: i32,
    }

    // With the derive macro, you can implement many traits. For example: Default, Clone, Copy, Serialize/Deserialize

## Generic Blanket Implementations

Blanket implementations leverage Rust‚Äôs ability to use generic parameters. You can use them to define shared behavior using traits. It is a great way to remove redundancy in code by reducing the need to repeat the code for different types with similar functionality.

    ```rust
    use core::fmt::Display;
    // Implementation ToString for generic trait T.
    // In this case, T must have an implementation of the Display trait.
    impl<T: Display> ToString for T {}
    ```

## SuperTraits

Supertraits are something like inheritance in OOP languages. üëá Example:

    ```rust
    trait Engine {
        fn start(&mut self);
        fn stop(&mut self);
        fn state(&self) -> bool;
    }

    trait Transmission {
        fn set_gear(&mut self, _: i32);
        fn gear(&self) -> i32;
    }

    trait Vehicle: Engine+Transmission {
        fn wheel_count(&self) -> u32;
    }

    trait Car: Vehicle {
        fn fuel_type(&self) -> FuelType;
    }

    as you can see, the Vehicle has all functions of the Engine and the Transmission; the Car has functions of all traits.
    ```

## Creating Trait Objects 

The Rust doesn't have polymorphism, but there is a similar feature - dispatch. Dispatch may be static or dynamic.

    ```rust 

    trait Vehicle {
        fn wheel_count(&self) -> u32;
    }

    #[derive (Default)] 
    struct Car; 
    impl Vehicle for Car {
        fn wheel_count(&self) -> u32 {
            4 
        }
    }

    #[derive (Default)]
    struc Motorcycle;
    impl Vehicle for Motorcycle {
        fn wheel_count(&self) -> u32 {
            2 
        }
    }

    fn wheel_count_static<T: Vehicle>(obj : &T) -> u32 {
        obj.wheel_count()
    }

    fn wheel_count_dynamic(obj: &dyn Vehicle) -> u32 {
        obj.wheel_count()
    }

    here you can see an implementation of the Vehicle trait for two different types and functions with similar behavior, but the "wheel_count_static" is static, and the "wheel_count_dynamic" is dynamic.

    // üëá Example of using:

    fn main() {
        let car = Car::Default();
        println!("{}", wheel_count_static(&car));
        println!("{}", wheel_count_dynamic(&car));

        let motorcycle =  Motorcycle::default();
        println!("{}", wheel_count_static(&motorcycle));
        println!("{}", wheel_count_dynamic(&motorcycle));
    }
    ```

## Trait Objects versus Enumerations

The second method of polymorphism in Rust is Enum. üëá Example:

    ```rust
    enum Vehicle {
        Car { wheel_count: u32 },
        Motorcycle { wheel_count: u32 },
    }

    impl Vehicle {
        fn new_car() -> Self {
            Self::Car { wheel_count: 4 }
        } 
        fn new_motorcycle() -> Self {
            Self::Motorcycle { wheel_count: 2 }
        }
        fn wheel_count(&self) -> u32 {
            match self {
                Vehicle::Car { wheel_count, .. } => *wheel_count,
                Vehicle::Motorcycle { wheel_count, .. } => *wheel_count,
            }
        }
    }

    fn main() {
        let car =  Vehicle::new_car();
        println!("{}", car.wheel_count());

        let motorcycle =  Vehicle::new_motorcycle();
        println!("{}", motorcycle.wheel_count());
    }
    ```
