## TCP 

1. Here is how you could write an echo server that can handle one client at a time ðŸ‘‰

    ```rust

    use std::io::{Read, Result, Write};

    fn main() -> Result<()> {
        let listener = std::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:12345")?;

        // This single threaded server can handle only one incoming connection at a
        // time.
        for stream in listener.incoming() {
            let mut stream = stream?;
            let mut buffer = [0u8; 4096];
            let count = stream.read(&mut buffer)?;
            stream.write_all(&buffer[0..count])?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    ```

2. And this is how you write and read data over a `TcpStream` as a client ðŸ‘‡

    ```rust
    use std::io::{Read, Result, Write};

    fn main() -> Result<()> {
        let mut stream = std::net::TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:12345")?;

        stream.write_all(&[0, 1, 2, 3])?;

        let mut buffer = [0u8; 4];
        stream.read_exact(&mut buffer)?;
        println!("Received {buffer:?}");

        Ok(())
    }
    ```

## UDP

1. If you want to use the User Datagram Protocol, which provides no guarantees about the order in which frames are sent nor guarantees delivery, you can use the ðŸ‘‰ UdpSocket.

    ```rust
    use std::net::UdpSocket;

    fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
        let socket = UdpSocket::bind("127.0.0.1:34254")?;

        // Receives a single datagram message on the socket. If `buf` is too small to hold
        // the message, it will be cut off.
        let mut buf = [0; 10];
        let (amt, src) = socket.recv_from(&mut buf)?;

        // Redeclare `buf` as slice of the received data and send reverse data back to origin.
        let buf = &mut buf[..amt];
        buf.reverse();
        socket.send_to(buf, &src)?;
        Ok(())
    }
    ```

## Lesson Summary 

In this lesson, you've learned about TCP and UDP through examples, explored how to write an echo server that can handle one client at a time, and how to use User Datagram Protocol.
