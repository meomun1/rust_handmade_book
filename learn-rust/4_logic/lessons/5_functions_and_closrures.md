# Functions and Closures

## Basic concepts

1. Functions are the building blocks of readable, maintainable, and reusable code. In this lesson, youâ€™ll discover different functions and how to declare them

2. While implementing a program, you often think of different layers of abstraction. When writing data into a database, you are not concerned about how to write bytes to the network interface and ensure you donâ€™t lose any information in transit. Use functions, closures, and methods to facilitate abstracting and reusing pieces of code.

## Functions 

1. In Rust, a function can be declared as follows:

    ```rust 
    fn fn_name(input1: InputType1, input2, InputType2) -> OutputType {
    // body
    }

    // example 
    fn u32_add(a: u32, b:u32) -> u32{
        return a + b;
    }

    // function in function => function g can not be accessed outside function f
    fn f(n: u32) -> u32 {
        fn g(n: u32) -> u32 {
            n + 1
        }

        g(n * 2)
    }
    println!("{}", f(3));
    ```

2. The main function. A Rust executable actually needs a function that defines the entry point of the program

    ```rust
    fn main(){
        println!("I am the first statement executed by this program!");
    }

3. Associated Functions. You know how to create your data types through `struct` and `enum` => You can attach functions to these types. If those functions take a value of, or a reference to, a value of the type, they are also referred to as methods. ðŸ‘‰ A method of a type `T` is a function where the first argument is a reference to or value of `T`

    ```rust 
    struct X(&'static str);

    impl X {
        fn associated_fn() -> &'static str {
            "I am always the same"
        }

        fn method(self : &Self) -> &'static str {
            self.0
        }
    }

    // Call a function associated to the type `X`.
    println!("{}", X::associated_fn());
    // Create an instance of X and call a method on the instance.
    let instance = X("My value depends on an instance of `X`!");
    println!("{}", instance.method());

    // I am always the same!
    // My value depends on an instance of `X`!
    ```

## Closures 

1. Closures are very similar to functions, except they have the ability to "capture their environment". This can be useful, for example when working with iterators. `n` is incremented with every invocation of `c`. Closures are turned into a`struct` itself contains a number reference to `n` and you have to declare `let mut c`

    ```rust
    let mut n = 0;
    let mut c = |x| {
        n += 1;
        x + n - 1
    };
    println!("{}", c(2));
    println!("{}", c(2));
    println!("{}", c(2));

    
    2
    3
    4
    ```

2. Closures are most commonly used when iterating over collections of values.

    ```rust
    let a = [1, 2, 3];
    let n : i32  = a.iter().map(|x| x * 2).sum();
    println!("Sum of {:?} after doubling: {}", a, n);

    // Sum of [1, 2, 3] after doubling: 12
    ```

## Lesson Summary

A function is a set of statements to perform a specific task. Functions organize the program into logical blocks of code. In this lesson, youâ€™ve learned about functions and closures. As well, you have discovered the way of their implementation.
