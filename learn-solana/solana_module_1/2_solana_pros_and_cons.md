# Solana pros and cons

## A word about Solana's features

 Solana's main features you should know:

`Archivers` ‚Äì Solana data is offloaded from validators to a network of nodes,Periodically, they are checked to ensure that the stored information is correct; 

`Cloudbreak`‚Äì a horizontally scalable database of accounts;

`Gulf Stream` ‚Äì a protocol that determines when and how transactions exchange;

`Pipeline` ‚Äì a transaction processing unit to optimize validation;

`Proof-of-History (PoH)` ‚Äì an addition to the Proof-of-stake consensus algorithm that improves the efficiency and capacity of Solana's network;

`Sealevel ‚Äì parallel smart contracts run-time;

`Tower BFT` ‚Äì an algorithm that takes advantage of synchronized clocks. Tower BFT uses PoH as its cryptographic clock;

`Turbine` ‚Äì a protocol that simplifies data transfer to blockchain nodes by breaking data into smaller packets.

## Why do users choose Solana?

So, what are the advantages of Solana? One key advantage is `the incredible transaction processing speed`, thousands of times faster than a popular blockchain like Ethereum. 

The network's native token is the SOL token, which, for the most part, is essential for steaming and paying commissions. The not-insignificant thing is that the blockchain burns up half of the commission amount to maintain the annual inflation rate of the SOL token. The commission payment takes place in fractions of the token, which are named `‚Äúlamports‚Äù` and correspond to `0.000000001 SOL`. Usually, the commission per transaction does not even exceed $0.05, which makes the Solana blockchain even more attractive! 

üëâ If we compare it to Ethereum, Solana has no mempool and hence no delays in processing the transaction and adding it to the blockchain.
